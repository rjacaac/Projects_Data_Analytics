# Projects_Data_Analytics

Welcome to My_Projects! This repository is a curated collection of my personal projects in the field of Data Science, organized into three main categories: Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and SQL. Each category is dedicated to showcasing a range of skills, insights, and methodologies applied to real-world datasets.

## Data Analytics

The Data Analytics folder focuses on statistical analysis, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques. Here's what you can find:

- **Survey_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb**: An in-depth Jupyter Notebook exploring a survey dataset, focusing on understanding respondent demographics and preferences.
- **Data_Wrangling.ipynb**: Demonstrates techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: A comprehensive EDA notebook, identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset.
- **Data_Visualization.ipynb**: Showcases various data visualization techniques to represent the findings clearly and effectively.
- **Tech Trend Analytics.pdf**: A presentation summarizing the key insights and trends identified through the analysis of technology datasets.
- **Hands-on-Lab_Maps-and-Geospatial-Data.ipynb**: This notebook introduces working with maps and geospatial data to visualize geographic information.

## Machine Learning

This folder contains projects that apply machine learning models to predict outcomes and extract insights from data. Projects demonstrate the use of different algorithms, evaluation metrics, and data preprocessing techniques.

- **Australia_Rain_Prediction.ipynb**: A detailed project predicting rain in Australia using several ML models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Linear Regression. The notebook covers:
  - ML Algorithms and Evaluation Metrics Used
  - About the Data
  - Importing Data
  - Data Preprocessing & One Hot Encoding
  - Train and Test Data Split
  - Training Models and Reporting Model Metrics

## SQL

The SQL folder showcases my ability to utilize SQL for data querying, manipulation, and analysis, with a focus on real-world applications.

- **SQL_Project_Chicago-Data.ipynb**: This project explores various socioeconomic, educational, and safety metrics of Chicago using SQL queries to derive meaningful insights and patterns.

### Thank you for exploring my repository. I hope you find these projects insightful and useful!
